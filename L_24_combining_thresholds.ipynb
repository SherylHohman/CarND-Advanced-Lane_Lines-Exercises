    "If you play around with the thresholds in the last exercise, you'll find that you can start to identify the lane lines by gradient direction alone by setting the threshold around `thresh = (0.7, 1.3`), but there's still a lot of noise in the resulting image.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now consider how you can use various aspects of your gradient measurements ***(x, y, magnitude, direction)** to isolate lane-line pixels. Specifically, think about how you can use thresholds of the x and y gradients, the overall gradient magnitude, and the gradient direction to focus on **pixels that are likely to be part of the lane lines**.  \n",
