    "#### Sobel Operator  \n",
    "The Sobel operator is at the heart of the Canny edge detection algorithm you used in the Introductory Lesson. Applying the Sobel operator to an image is a way of taking the derivative of the image in the x or y direction. The operators for `Sobel  ​x  ​​` and `Sobel  ​y  ​​` , respectively, look like this:  \n",
    "<img src='l21-soble-operator.png' />\n",
    "\n",
    "These are examples of Sobel operators with a kernel size of 3 (implying a 3 x 3 operator in each case). This is the minimum size, but the kernel size can be any odd number. A larger kernel implies taking the gradient over a larger region of the image, or, in other words, a smoother gradient.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To understand how these operators take the derivative, you can think of overlaying either one on a 3 x 3 region of an image. If the image is flat across that region, then the result (summing the element-wise product of the operator and corresponding image pixels) will be zero. If, instead, for example, you apply the `S  ​x  ​​ ` operator to a region of the image where values are rising from left to right, then the result will be positive, implying a positive derivative.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Derivative Example  \n",
    "If we apply the Sobel x and y operators to this image: \n",
    "<img src='l21-curved-lane.jpg' /> \n",
    "\n",
    "And then we take the absolute value, we get the result:  \n",

    " <img src='l21-sobelx-vs-sobely.png' />\n",
    "Absolute value of Sobel x (left) and Sobel y (right).   \n",
    "\n",
    "In the above images, you can see that the gradients taken in both the x and the y directions detect the lane lines and pick up other edges. Taking the gradient in the x direction emphasizes edges closer to vertical. Alternatively, taking the gradient in the y direction emphasizes edges closer to horizontal.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the upcoming exercises, you'll write functions to take various thresholds of the x and y gradients. Here's some code that might be useful:  \n",

    "```   \n",
