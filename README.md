## Camera Calibration with OpenCV

The IPython notebook in this repository contains code to calculate 
the camera matrix and distortion coefficients 
using the images in the "calibration_wide" folder.

## Challenge: Calibrate your own camera!
If you're up for a challenge, try these steps on your own camera images. Just:  
- print out a chessboard pattern, 
- stick it to a flat surface, and 
- take 20 or 30 pictures of it.
 Make sure to take pictures of the pattern over the entire field of view, 
 particularly near the edges.

To extract object points and image points, use the Jupyter notebook in this repository. 
If you're following along with the code in the notebook, 
be sure you set the right size for your chessboard, 
the link above is to a 9 x 6 pattern, 
while before we were using an 8 x 6.
